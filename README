This script allows you to monitor your favorite livestreams
and easily select through the currently live ones.

It uses livestreamer as the backend for playing and checking streams,
and dmenu for the selection menu. It supports any streams that
livestreamer can play.

Usage: bashstreams.sh [commands...]

Commands available:
reload - reload the list of streams currently live (stored in ~/.live)
dmenu - Run dmenu with a list of currently live streams
stream - Run a stream by name

You can also do "bashstreams.sh reload dmenu" to check for livestreams and
then immediately run dmenu. However if you have a large amount of streams in
your config file this may be slow.

Configuration file is in ~/.streams . Each line in the file is a stream
to track. The format is <stream url> <stream alias>

This script requires livestreamer ( https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer ),
jshon, and dmenu.
